            The sky is the appearance of the atmosphere around the surface of the planet from
            our point of view. We see many objects that are actually in space such as the Sun, 
            the Moon, and stars because they are in the sky. On a clear day the sky appears blue.
            At night it appears from very dark purple to black. The deepness of the blue increases 
            as we look toward the horizon, and up to the point above us.
